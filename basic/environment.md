title: School exercise environment
layout: main
---

The goal of this step is for you to get familiar with the ESC working
environment and check that everything is correctly set up for the
school exercises.

If something doesn't work as expected, please ask one of the
organizers.

When using these computing resources you agree to comply with the "Regulation on
the use of INFN computing resources", available in
[Italian](https://www.cnaf.infn.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disciplinare_2020_IT.pdf)
and
[English](https://www.cnaf.infn.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disciplinare_2020_EN.pdf).
Please read also the "General information note on processing of personal data by
INFN", available in
[Italian](https://dpo.infn.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Informativa_generale_INFN_181204.pdf)
and
[English](https://dpo.infn.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informativa_generale_181204_EN.pdf).

## Wi-Fi access

You can use either the `eduroam` or the `CeUB` Wi-Fi networks. For the latter
you should have received your personal credentials.

## SSH access to School computers

You have been assigned a personal account to access computing resources hosted
at INFN-CNAF. The username has the form `studentN`, where `N` is a number
between 104 and 120. You should have received a mail from _sysop@cnaf.infn.it_
with subject _Account at CNAF_, including the credentials and the instructions
to log on the CNAF gateway host. If you haven't received the mail, check in your
SPAM folder. In the following, when you see `studentN`, replace it with your
personal username.

To log on the computers prepared for the School, you have to go first through
the CNAF gateway host, named `bastion.cnaf.infn.it`, with the username
`studentN`.

```shell
[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh studentN@bastion.cnaf.infn.it
studentN@bastion.cnaf.infn.it's password:
Last login: ...
[studentN@bastion ~]$
```

From `bastion` you can then log onto the School computers. There are four
servers available: `hpc-201-11-40.cr.cnaf.infn.it`,
`hpc-200-06-06.cr.cnaf.infn.it`, `hpc-200-06-17.cr.cnaf.infn.it` and
`hpc-200-06-18.cr.cnaf.infn.it`. The first one is the most powerful and should
easily support all the students during their exercises, so prefer that one, in
particular for the GPU exercises; the others are meant mainly for the MPI
exercises but are good enough also for all the rest (except for the GPU
hands-on). In fact when doing exercises that ask to measure performance, feel
free to try all the machines and see if there are differences.

The names of the machines are awful, we know, but you can get around it by
creating a config file for ssh. With the ssh configuration **on your laptop**
you can also avoid the explicit jump through the `bastion` host and forward the
X11 display and the SSH agent.

```shell
[me@mylaptop ~]$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host bastion
  Hostname bastion.cnaf.infn.it
  User studentN

Host esc
  Hostname hpc-201-11-40.cr.cnaf.infn.it
  User studentN
  ProxyJump bastion

Host *
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardAgent yes

[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh esc
studentN@hpc-201-11-40.cr.cnaf.infn.it's password:
Last login: ...
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$
```

To further simplify the login to `esc`, you can use an SSH key. You first need
to create it (if you don't have one already), copy it remotely on both `bastion`
and `esc` and set it in your SSH configuration.

```shell
[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh-keygen -C studentN@esc -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
...
[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc bastion
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/me/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc.pub"
...
studentN@hpc-201-11-40.cr.cnaf.infn.it's password: 
...
[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc esc
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/me/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc.pub"
...
studentN@hpc-201-11-40.cr.cnaf.infn.it's password: 
...
[me@mylaptop ~]$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host bastion
  Hostname bastion.cnaf.infn.it
  User studentN
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc

Host esc
  Hostname hpc-201-11-40.cr.cnaf.infn.it
  User studentN
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_student_esc
  ProxyJump bastion

Host *
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardAgent yes
[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh esc
Last login: ...
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ 
```

Your shell is [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/s/bash). We suggest that you copy a skeleton for the shell configuration files in your home directory:

```shell
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ cp /etc/skel/.bash* ~
```

Please note that:

* The `bastion` host is useful and needed only as a gateway to `esc`. Don't do
  anything else on it.
* Each `esc` computer is not assigned exclusively to a student.
* Your home directory is shared between all `esc` computers, but not with `bastion`.
* Your home directory will be wiped out and your `studentN` account will be
  disabled soon after the end of the School. Please make sure to save somewhere
  else what you want to keep.

## School material

All the school hands-on material is included in a git repository. Get it using:

```shell
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ git clone https://github.com/infn-esc/esc23.git
```

The repository contains also these pages.

## Enable the compiler

Log into `esc`, enable the use of `gcc 12.3` and check that it's available

```shell
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ module load compilers/gcc-12.3_sl7
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 12.3.0
...
```

To guarantee that the module is always loaded in the environment, you can add
the `module load` in the shell initialization file.

```shell
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ echo 'module load compilers/gcc-12.3_sl7' >> ${HOME}/.bashrc
```

## Install oneAPI Threading Building Blocks

Let's install the latest release of oneAPI TBB.

```shell
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ wget https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/releases/download/v2021.10.0/oneapi-tbb-2021.10.0-lin.tgz
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ sha256sum oneapi-tbb-2021.10.0-lin.tgz
d5be4164a1f2e67a8c7bc927cbe2b36690815adb48d36e50b9e3b8afa4c99310  oneapi-tbb-2021.10.0-lin.tgz
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ tar zxf oneapi-tbb-2021.10.0-lin.tgz
```

Before working on the exercises that require oneAPI TBB, remember to enable it:

```shell
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ export TBBROOT=${HOME}/oneapi-tbb-2021.10.0
[studentN@hpc-201-11-40 ~]$ source ${TBBROOT}/env/vars.sh intel64 linux auto_tbbroot
```

## Editing source code

### Editing locally

On `esc` you can find several editors available, such as `vim`, `emacs`, `nano`. If
the X display is available, graphical editors will open a window on your laptop;
the network latency however may not be good enough to give you a fine
experience. Just try.

### Editing remotely

The best option to edit files remotely is to use [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with its [remote development
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

Alternatively you could edit the source code for the exercises on your laptop,
synchronizing them with the `esc` machine, for example using one of the
following:

* `scp`: You can copy files remotely using `scp`, in both directions.

* `sshfs`: You can mount your `esc` home directory on your laptop via `sshfs`.

* `rsync`: You can synchronize your local workspace with the one you keep on `esc`
  using [`rsync`](http://rsync.samba.org/). Please refer to the `rsync` manual to
  fully understand the meaning of the different options, so to avoid mistakes
  that could cause loss of data.

For all these options to work seamlessly, however, you should first simplify
your use of SSH to connect to `esc`, as described above.
